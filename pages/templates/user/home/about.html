  <b>TomChienXuOJ</b> is abbreviated to <b class="rgb">TomChienXu Online Judge System</b>. <b><i>T√¥m Chi√™n X√π</i> (or <i>Tempura</i> in Japanese)</b> is <i>deep fried shrimp</i> [indeed <(")], a name which was generated by our randomness and senselessness at that moment.
  <br>
  Actually, this new system is the upgraded version of our old Online Judge Platform <b class="rgb"><a href="https://epicoj.ml">EpicOJ</a></b> (or the <a href="https://beta.epicoj.ml">Beta version</a>), the <b>ready-to-be-released</b> version of this site was actually nearly completed, but has been always off the record since then.
</p>
<p>
  As I've said since the first version of this site, which is <b class="rgb">EpicOJ</b>, was being developed, the purpose of building this site is to provide competitive coders from anywhere (in fact only members of <b>Together CPP</b> have used it :>) a simple, small, be able for everyone to self-host on all operating systems, convenience online judge and real-time contest hosting platform.
  <br>
  Yes, you did hear right! You can self-host it, even the operating you're using is <b>Windows</b>, <b>MacOS</b>, <b>Linux</b> <i>(yea, ofc)</i>,... You just have to install the compilers of the languages the judge uses, then you're good to go! Our system will automatically test the compiling system every time you start the server. Check it out for more information on <a href="{{ url_for('user_view.judges') }}">this</a> page.
</p>
<p>
  Self-host? Hmmm, you could do anything you want! Create and spam $69420$ announcements, add your own contests and set every problem on it $10^4$ points each to bypass the rating system, create $1234$ unused judges, host unprofessional-tournaments for your friends and brothers, abuse power of permissions as an Administrator, set Username and Role name to a string which contains a number of cursed unicode characters üíÄ, install <i>Brainf*ck</i>, <i>UwU</i>, <i>Lemonade</i>,... any mother-f*cker programming languages as you want.
  <br>
</p>
<p class="text-center">Conclusion, you can do anything that you and the bros wanted to do :) Nothing is limited in <b class="rgb">TomChienXuOJ</b>.</p>
